	  <td align="left" valign="top" class="aboutme-text">Jack Walsh was born in Phoenix, AZ, on October 23rd, 2001. Ever since that day Jack has pursued a life of creativity. At a young age, Jack and his family moved north to Pierre, South Dakota, much closer to his relatives in Sioux City, Iowa. From there his lifestyle of creating began with toys such as building blocks, Lincoln logs, and legos. Thousands of creations we put together by Jack. Lego buildings, made again and again, Lincoln logs, constructed in hundreds of manners, and building blocks that test the limits of gravity. Soon after testing the limits of physical creation, Jack discovered creativity in the form of technology. Whether it was art softwares or video games, Jack was always leaving his mark in all of his projects. Jack’s love for creativity eventually evolved into a love for architecture. A heavy interest in the built environment led Jack on a path to architecture school. Jack’s love for creativity spans further than just architecture. He has picked up an interest in video games and website design. Jack always tries to stay involved in extra activities. Jack served as a member of the South Dakota State AIAS board as the Secretary. He also served as Co-Coordinator on the South Dakota State Student Advisory Board for the department of architecture. Jack aims to better his connection with his students and faculty as well as develop his design identity. </td>
