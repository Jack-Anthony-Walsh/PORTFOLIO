      <td align="center" valign="top" class="zine-text"><p>Architecture and graphics have gone hand in hand since the profession of architecture began. Architects use visuals and graphics as their main source of design and communication to clients, other architects, and the general public. This method of communication has changed over the years as our technology has further developed. For instance, building renders were hand drawn by architects and drafters to convey the structure’s identity. Now, as technology has evolved, renders are produced using computer software as a more efficient means. This drastically changes the graphical style of work produced by architects. Through these tools and communication assets we, as architects, create our own graphical identity. This graphical identity begins with students in architecture education. There they learn how to effectively communicate their designs to architects and the public alike. Drafting techniques and architectural softwares are introduced to the students giving them a plethora of tools to use in design. These skills honed by students should then be included and grown in the professional world.</p>

<p>After creating a successful and inclusive graphical standard, firms then turn to communicating with the client. When communicating with the client there is no defined line that has to be reached in the amount of graphical details. When does the project have too much information? When is the project lacking in information? These questions are often solved through what the client specifies in their request. However, going beyond the requests to give the client inspiration or a different view of their needs should be communicated through graphics. The client should not only be fulfilled in their request, but should have gained new ideas and inspiration for what new can come next.</p>
