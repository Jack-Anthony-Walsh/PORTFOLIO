      <td align="center" valign="top" class="zine-text">Architecture and graphics have gone hand in hand since the profession of architecture began. Architects use visuals and graphics as their main source of design and communication to clients, other architects, and the general public. This method of communication has changed over the years as our technology has further developed. For instance, building renders were hand drawn by architects and drafters to convey the structure’s identity. Now, as technology has evolved, renders are produced using computer software as a more efficient means. This drastically changes the graphical style of work produced by architects. Through these tools and communication assets we, as architects, create our own graphical identity. This graphical identity begins with students in architecture education. There they learn how to effectively communicate their designs to architects and the public alike. Drafting techniques and architectural softwares are introduced to the students giving them a plethora of tools to use in design. This gives the students a strong graphic identity as they transition into the professional world.

Many new architects, however, sacrifice their graphic identity when joining an architectural firm. Architectural firms all have their own collective graphical style that they use. When joining these new firms, new architects are forced to adapt and learn these new graphical techniques and identity in order to design as a uniform firm. While having a uniform style benefits the collective by creating a strong collaborative work output, it also hinders the personal graphical growth of individual architects. While some architects might fit right into the firm’s mold, other architects' graphical styles may vary greatly. Architectural firm leaders should take the initiative aiding in the development of employees' graphical identities. implementing successful elements of architects’ styles into a firm’s graphical standard would not only benefit the individual in their personal growth, but it would better the firm as its employees become more skilled and confident in what they do.

After creating a successful and inclusive graphical standard, firms then turn to communicating with the client. When communicating with the client there is no defined line that has to be reached in the amount of graphical details. When does the project have too much information? When is the project lacking in information? These questions are often solved through what the client specifies in their request. However, going beyond the requests to give the client inspiration or a different view of their needs should be communicated through graphics. The client should not only be fulfilled in their request, but should have gained new ideas and inspiration for what new can come next.
